<h3>What is Infrapipe?</h3>

Infrapipe is an open source, end-to-end, right out of the box, secure DevOps platform that you can control and deploy in your own cloud provider. It is the center of achieving all the goodness of an enterprise secure solution but also the agility and speed a start-up needs.

Infrapipe combines the power of code and infrastructure being deployed from one repository to allow developers to make strategic infrastructure changes along with their application code to enhance productivity.

Infrapipe is a utility to make secure cloud infrastructure and application deployments easier for anyone regardless of skill level. As an opinionated delivery pipeline solution it is configured to work with a specific CI tool, currently with Gitlab but it can be setup to use other CI tools.

The intent is to make Engineers, Developers, and other enthusiasts quickly productive in deploying "known-good" application architectures into the most common cloud platform technologies.

<p style="color:#1E88E5">The goal is to have the experience of going from "git clone" to production as fast, as secure and as compliant as possible.</p>

<h3>What problems does it solve?</h3>
Managing public cloud provider infrastructure the right way is really hard and constantly changing. There are many ways to deploy applications but how to do you ensure you aren't doing it in an inefficient, slow, inconsistent, insecure and difficult to maintain way?<br>

<ul>
<li>
<b><p>Infrapipe was designed to allow you to avoid all of the questions, just focus on developing your application and use known secure patterns to deliver code</p></b>
</li>
</ul>

How do you allow developers manage infrastructure with code without breaking critical underlying components and accessing areas they don't need to perform their job?

<ul>
<li><b><p>Infrapipe doesn't isolate the developer, it empowers them to work quickly within a set of guide rails while not compromising underlying infrastructure or assets not needed to perform their daily job.</p></b></li>
</ul>

Managing infrastructure and deploying applications, even in the cloud, in a traditional manner will only meet meet short business objectives but will it severely limit the ability to scale and grow your mission.

<ul>
<li>
<b>When you reboot your thinking and perspective your mindset needs to be <a href="/sasse" target="_blank">SASSE</a>.</b>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>How is Infrapipe SASSE?</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Simple</b> - Infrapipe gives you a simple central platform that deploys cloud assets, code and infrastructure in one process.</li>
<li><b>Automated</b> - With Infrapipe codifying everything and doing it in an automated way that can be repeated consistently in any environment.</li>
<li><b>Secure</b> - Infrapipe has the integrations you need to be secure from the start means making risk, audit and governance teams happy you are meeting their controls from initial push to dev.</li>
<li><b>Sustainable</b> - Infrapipe is a sustainable solution which won't increase your IT, DevOps, SRE workforce when the number of applications increase or the frequency of deployment increases.</li>
<li><b>Evidenced</b> - With Infrapipe handling all the orchestration you will know that you are doing what you say you do and having the evidence to back it up when audit time comes.</li>
</ul>

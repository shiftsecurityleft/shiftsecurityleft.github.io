CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS LIMITATION REPRESENTS A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK, AND THAT SHIFT SECURITY LEFT WOULD NOT PROVIDE THE SYSTEM EXCEPT UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.

<p>Indemnification. The Company acknowledges and agrees to defend, at its expense, any third party action or suit brought against the Customer alleging that the System infringes intellectual property rights held by any third party (&ldquo;IP Infringement Claim&ldquo;), and the Company will pay any damages awarded in final judgment against the Customer that are attributable to any such claim; provided that (i) the Customer notifies the Company promptly in writing of such claim; and (ii) the Customer will grant the Company authority to handle the defense or settlement of any such claim, suit or proceeding and will provide the Company with all reasonable information and assistance, at Company&rsquo;s expense.

Shift Security Left shall not be liable for failing or delaying performance of its obligations and/or failure of operation of the System and/or failure to grant the Services resulting from any condition beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to, governmental action, acts of terrorism, earthquake, fire, flood or other acts of God, labor conditions, power failures, and Internet disturbances.
